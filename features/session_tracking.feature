Feature: Session Tracking

  Background:
    Given I clear all persistent data

  Scenario: Launching using the default configuration sends a single session
    When I run "AutoSessionScenario"
    And I wait to receive a request
    And the request is valid for the session reporting API
    And the payload field "sessions" is an array with 1 elements
    And the payload field "app.version" equals "1.0.3"
    And the payload field "app.bundleVersion" equals "5"
    And the payload field "app.releaseStage" equals "development"
    And the payload field "app.type" equals one of:
      | ios   | iOS   |
      | macos | macOS |
    And the payload field "device.osName" equals one of:
      | ios   | iOS    |
      | macos | Mac OS |
    And the payload field "device.model" matches the test device model

    And the payload field "sessions.0.id" is a UUID
    And the payload field "sessions.0.startedAt" is a parsable timestamp in seconds
    And the session "user.id" is not null
    And the session "user.email" is null
    And the session "user.name" is null

  Scenario: Configuring a custom version sends it in a session request
    When I run "AutoSessionCustomVersionScenario"
    And I wait to receive a request
    And the request is valid for the session reporting API
    And the payload field "sessions" is an array with 1 elements
    And the payload field "app.version" equals "2.0.14"
    And the payload field "app.bundleVersion" equals "5"
    And the payload field "app.releaseStage" equals "development"
    And the payload field "app.type" equals one of:
      | ios   | iOS   |
      | macos | macOS |
    And the payload field "device.osName" equals one of:
      | ios   | iOS    |
      | macos | Mac OS |
    And the payload field "device.model" matches the test device model

    And the payload field "sessions.0.id" is a UUID
    And the payload field "sessions.0.startedAt" is a parsable timestamp in seconds
    And the session "user.id" is not null
    And the session "user.email" is null
    And the session "user.name" is null

  Scenario: Configuring user info sends it with auto-captured sessions
    When I run "AutoSessionWithUserScenario"
    And I wait to receive a request
    And the request is valid for the session reporting API
    And the payload field "sessions" is an array with 1 elements
    And the payload field "sessions.0.id" is a UUID
    And the payload field "sessions.0.startedAt" is a parsable timestamp in seconds
    And the session "user.id" equals "123"
    And the session "user.email" equals "joe@example.com"
    And the session "user.name" equals "Joe Bloggs"

  Scenario: Configuring user info sends it with manually captured sessions
    When I run "ManualSessionWithUserScenario"
    And I wait to receive a request
    And the request is valid for the session reporting API
    And the payload field "sessions" is an array with 1 elements
    And the payload field "sessions.0.id" is a UUID
    And the payload field "sessions.0.startedAt" is a parsable timestamp in seconds
    And the session "user.id" equals "123"
    And the session "user.email" equals "joe@example.com"
    And the session "user.name" equals "Joe Bloggs"

  Scenario: Disabling auto-capture and calling startSession() manually sends a single session
    When I run "ManualSessionScenario"
    And I wait to receive a request
    And the request is valid for the session reporting API
    And the payload field "sessions" is an array with 1 elements
    And the payload field "sessions.0.id" is a UUID
    And the payload field "sessions.0.startedAt" is a parsable timestamp in seconds
    # This behaviour isn't established yet
    # And the session "user.id" is null
    # And the session "user.email" is null
    # And the session "user.name" is null

  Scenario: Disabling auto-capture sends no sessions
    When I run "DisabledSessionTrackingScenario"
    And I wait for 3 seconds
    Then I should receive no requests

  Scenario: Encountering a handled event during a session
    When I run "AutoSessionHandledEventsScenario"
    And I wait to receive 3 requests
    Then the request is valid for the session reporting API
    And the payload field "sessions.0.id" is stored as the value "session_id"
    And I discard the oldest request

    Then the request is valid for the error reporting API
    And the payload field "events" is an array with 1 elements
    And the payload field "events.0.session.events.handled" equals 1
    And the payload field "events.0.session.id" equals the stored value "session_id"
    And I discard the oldest request

    Then the request is valid for the error reporting API
    And the payload field "events" is an array with 1 elements
    And the payload field "events.0.session.events.handled" equals 2
    And the payload field "events.0.session.id" equals the stored value "session_id"

  Scenario: Encountering an unhandled event during a session
    When I run "AutoSessionUnhandledScenario"
    And I wait for 4 seconds
    And I relaunch the app
    And I set the app to "noevent" mode
    And I configure Bugsnag for "AutoSessionUnhandledScenario"
    And I wait to receive 2 requests
    Then the request is valid for the session reporting API
    And the payload field "sessions" is an array with 1 elements
    And the payload field "sessions.0.id" is a UUID
    And the payload field "sessions.0.startedAt" is a parsable timestamp in seconds
    And the payload field "sessions.0.id" is stored as the value "session_id"
    And I discard the oldest request

    Then the request is valid for the error reporting API
    And the payload field "events" is an array with 1 elements
    And the payload field "events.0.session.events.handled" equals 0
    And the payload field "events.0.session.events.unhandled" equals 1
    And the payload field "events.0.session.id" equals the stored value "session_id"

  Scenario: Encountering handled and unhandled events during a session
    When I run "AutoSessionMixedEventsScenario"
    And I wait for 5 seconds
    And I relaunch the app
    And I configure Bugsnag for "AutoSessionMixedEventsScenario"
    And I wait to receive 5 requests
    Then the request is valid for the session reporting API
    And the payload field "sessions" is an array with 1 elements
    And the session "id" is not null
    And the session "startedAt" is not null
    And the payload field "sessions" is an array with 1 elements
    And I discard the oldest request
    Then the request is valid for the session reporting API
    And I discard the oldest request
    And the received requests match:
        | exceptions.0.errorClass | session.events.handled | session.events.unhandled |
        | FirstErr                | 1                      | 0                        |
        | SecondErr               | 2                      | 0                        |
        | Kaboom                  | 2                      | 1                        |

    Then the request is valid for the error reporting API
    And I discard the oldest request
    Then the request is valid for the error reporting API
    And I discard the oldest request
    Then the request is valid for the error reporting API
